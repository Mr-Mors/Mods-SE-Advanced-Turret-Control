Space Engineers Mod - Advanced Turret Control (Retro)


# Steam Discription
[b]First and foremost all credit for this mod modification goes to rearth and his [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=1479506454] rearth's Advanced Combat Systems (Slim Edition) [/url][/b] I take no credit for this mod.

This is my Retro edition of ATC. This is a stale branch of my mod incase you perver the old style of the mod:
[list]
 [*] Activating turret control with alt instead of the new right-click method
 [*] Only controlling turrets with the custom Turret Control Cockpit
 [*] All turrets by default being controlled instead of the new opt-in style
[list]

[b]Original description bellow:[/b]

This modification changes a few things from his base mod for the T•U•S server.

[list]
 [*] Fixed [url=https://steamcommunity.com/sharedfiles/filedetails/?id=970804258]Mexpex Warfare Industries v1.1.5[/url] turret rotation speed when controlled via this mod.
 [*] Removed when manually aiming a single turret all other turrets fire.
 [*] Removed Missile Launcher. Broken with game update.
 [*] Removed non-ship control cockpit. Game update broke turret control flight seat that doesn't control ship.
[/list]

[i]Following is mostly the same description text from rearth's mod for the parts that have not been changed.[/i]

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

There is a new Cockpit and Control Station for large and small Grids, which enable you to aim with all your turrets at once while in 3rd person view of the ship. Hold down the alt-key to aim with all your turrets while in the ship control block.

If you don't want a turret to aim synchronized with other turrets, add the word "exclude" to its name, and the mod will simply ignore it.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Of course, manually targeting all turrets while in battle may be less efficient than just letting the computer control them, but its much more fun and allows to pick off specific targets.

-----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Groups:
If you only want to control a specific control group of turrets, you have to name the controller the same way the control group is named. Then this controller will control only the turrets in the specific control group.
